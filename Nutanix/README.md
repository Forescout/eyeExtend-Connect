# Nutanix Connect App v1.0.0

This first version of Nutanix eyeExtend Connect App v1.0.0 is used to leverage PRISM v3 API to Poll / Resolve Properties from Nutanix Hyperconverged Platform through Prism Central. 

 Prism v3 is an Intentful API designed for full environment management via Nutanix Prism Central. We leveraged four API Endpoitns to List Hosts (Poll), or get an update of a specific Host Details (Resolve), in addition to List VMs (Poll) and update a specific VM Details (Resolve). For Poll queries, recursive Paging has been implemented to ensure all Hosts / VMs, including their properties details are Polled via Prism Central.
