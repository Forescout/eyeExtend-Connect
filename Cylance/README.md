# About eyeExtend for Cylance
Forescout eyeExtend for Cylance is an integration of the Forescout platform with CylancePROTECT®.

Forescout is recognized as a leading network-access control solution with continuous, agentless discovery of endpoint devices whether they are managed, unmanaged, or otherwise unknown. CylancePROTECT redefines the capabilities and efficiency of endpoint security. By leveraging artificial intelligence, malware can be detected and prevented in real time, before it even executes.

The integration of the Forescout platform with Cylance helps customers enforce compliance by assuring endpoints have the CylancePROTECT sensor and reduce the risk of having any unmanaged devices on their network. It also provides a means for the distribution of endpoint management software, which improves the user experience and increases operational efficiency.

The goal of eyeExtend for Cylance is to increase security protection across a wider device landscape that includes both traditional and non-traditional endpoints, including BYOD and IoT. This is achieved through continuous device discovery/visibility and rapid remediation to prevent the spread of threats and ensure endpoint compliance.

The Forescout integration with Cylance lets you:

- Fortify endpoint defenses, minimize security breaches, and reduce your attack surface
- Gain visibility and control of devices across your network and beyond
- Verify the presence of functional CylancePROTECT agents at connection time and enroll devices with missing agents
- Employ combined automated response options to quarantine or remediate infected devices

Together, the Forescout platform and Cylance can protect customers by providing both broad and deep endpoint discovery, threat detection, and remediation across a broad array of device types and networks. The Forescout platform also helps continually enforce device compliance upon network access. See Use Cases.

# Customer Support
The Connect Plugin is supported by Forescout Customer Support. See [https://forescout.force.com/support/s/](https://forescout.force.com/support/s/).

Connect Apps, including those provided by Forescout, are not supported by Forescout.

# About This Module
Forescout eyeExtend for Cylance supports information sharing and interaction with components of the Cylance cloud platform.

To use the module, you should have a basic understanding of Cylance concepts, functionality, and terminology, and understand how Forescout platform policies and other basic features work.

# Use Cases
This section describes important use cases supported by Forescout eyeExtend for Cylance.

## Cylance Agent Hygiene Policy
You can define a Forescout platform policy that ensures the CylancePROTECT agent is installed and functioning on all supported endpoints within the network. The module supports a set of host properties that detect CylancePROTECT agent status on endpoints. See Configure Cylance Agent Hygiene Policy.

## Policy-Based Response to Identified Risks
When the Forescout platform identifies that Cylance marked an endpoint as not safe (for example, due to malware or other malicious behavior), the Forescout platform performs an action to mitigate the risk. See Configure Cylance Endpoint Not Safe Policy.

# How It Works
The following Cylance components are required for this integrated solution:

- **Cylance User API:** The Forescout platform addresses the API exposed by the platform to retrieve endpoint information and perform actions.

The following Forescout platform components support the integration:

- **Forescout eyeExtend for Cylance:** This cloud-delivered module handles communication with Cylance and provides the properties, actions, and policies described in this guide.
- **Forescout eyeExtend Cloud:** A Forescout cloud service that handles third-party integrations including the integration with Cylance, which provides the endpoint properties and actions described in this guide.
- **Forescout eyeExtend Connect Plugin:** An infrastructure for integrating third-party vendors with the Forescout platform.
- **Forescout eyeExtend Cylance App:** The Connect App developed by Forescout to implement the integration with Cylance.

In a typical deployment, several cloud connections are defined in the Forescout platform. Connections to the cloud may be planned based on anticipated traffic or geographic location. The deployment is as follows:

- A single CounterACT® device connects to each cloud access point, handling communication for a cluster of CounterACT devices. The CounterACT devices in the cluster only work with that Cylance cloud instance.
- For each connection, the rate limiting of messaging from the Forescout platform to the Cylance cloud can be configured.
- The Forescout platform does not communicate directly with the CylancePROTECT agent on endpoints.

This deployment method scales efficiently and allows tuning of traffic loads.

5. Enter the following information:
- Connecting CounterACT Device: Select Enterprise Manager or an IP address of the connecting CounterACT device. In an environment where more than one CounterACT device is assigned to a single third-party instance, the connecting CounterACT Appliance functions as a middleman between the third-party instance and the CounterACT Appliance. The connecting CounterACT Appliance forwards all queries and requests to and from the third-party instance.
- Assign specific devices: This CounterACT Appliance is assigned to a third-party instance, but it does not communicate with it directly. All communication between the third-party instance and its assigned CounterACT Appliance is handled by the connecting CounterACT Appliance defined for the third-party instance. All the IP addresses handled by an assigned Appliance must also be handled by the third-party instance to which the Appliance is assigned.
  - Select **Available Devices** and then select an IP address or Appliance name from the Available Devices list.
  - Select **Add**. The selected device will send its requests to the third-party instance through the connecting Appliance.
- Assign all devices by default: This is the connecting Appliance to which CounterACT Appliances are assigned by default if they are not explicitly assigned to another connecting Appliance. Select this option to make this connecting Appliance the middleman for all CounterACT Appliances not assigned to another connecting device.

Note the following:

- An error message is displayed if you try to add a device that is already used.
- If you have apps that discover 50,000 or more endpoints, distribute the apps in such a way so that only up to two of the apps share the same focal (connecting) appliance. An alternative is to split the endpoints across multiple user accounts on multiple servers.

6. Select **Next**.

8. Enter the following information:
- Enable Host Discovery: Select this option to enable the **Discovery Frequency** field.
