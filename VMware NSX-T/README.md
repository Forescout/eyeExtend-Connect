2. Navigate to the component and hover over the name to view a tooltip indicating if it is running on Forescout devices in your deployment. In addition, next to the component name, you will see one of the following icons:  

- The component is stopped on all Forescout devices.  
- The component is stopped on some Forescout devices.  
- The component is running on all Forescout devices.  

3. If the component is not running, select **Start** , and then select the relevant Forescout devices.  
4. Select **OK**.

# Configure the Module
After eyeExtend Connect is installed, **Connect** is displayed under **Options**.

## Configure VMware NSX-T App
To configure eyeExtend Connect for VMware NSX-T, you import the VMware NSX-T App.

Initially, the App Configuration tab of the **Connect** pane is blank. The VMware NSX-T App has not been imported yet.

## Import an App
You can import the VMware NSX-T App.

To import the VMware NSX-T App:

In the App Configuration tab of the **Connect** pane, select **Import**.
Apps that can be imported are in .zip or .eca format. They can be in any folder.
	Select **Import**.  
If the app is imported successfully, a message is displayed at the bottom of the **Sending** dialog box. If the app is not imported successfully, error messages are displayed in the **Sending** dialog box.  

Select
**Close** when the import has finished.
A blank **System Description** dialog box opens. 

- If you select **Close** before the import has finished, it will fail.  

## Panels


After the app is imported, the **System Description** dialog box opens. It is initially blank and only the **Add** and **Import** buttons are enabled.  

To configure the VMware NSX-T App, you add a system description to define a connection, which includes login credentials.  

If a system description has not been configured and you select **OK** now, a warning message is displayed.  

Select **Add**

### VMware NSX-T Connection


Enter the following information:  

- Manager Address: Enter the VMware NSX-T manager IP address, FQDN or Hostname.
- Server Port: Enter the VMware NSX-T manager port. The default is TCP/443 
- Username: Enter the username for accessing VMware NSX-T
- Password: Enter and verify the password for accessing VMware NSX-T

Select **Next**


### Focal Appliance


 - Initially, the Assign Forescout Focal Appliance panel has only one option, **Assign all devices by default** , and it is selected so that one device is added.

If you want to add a second device, the Assign Forescout Focal Appliance panel has more options.

Enter the following information:

- Connecting CounterACT Device: Select Enterprise Manager or an IP address of the connecting Forescout Focal Appliance. In an environment where more than one Forescout Appliance is assigned to a single third-party instance, the connecting Forescout Focal Appliance functions as a middleman between the third-party instance and the Forescout Appliances. The connecting Forescout Focal Appliance forwards all queries and requests to and from the third-party instance.  
- Assign specific devices: This Forescout Appliance is assigned to a third-party instance, but it does not communicate with it directly. All communication between the third-party instance and its assigned Forescout Appliance is handled by the connecting Forescout Focal Appliance defined for the third-party instance. All the IP addresses handled by an assigned Appliance must also be handled by the third-party instance to which the Appliance is assigned.  
  - Select **Available Devices** and then select an IP address or Appliance name from the Available Devices list.  
  - Select **Add**. The selected device will send its requests to the third-party instance through the connecting Appliance.  
- Assign all devices by default: This is the connecting Appliance to which Forescout Appliances are assigned by default if they are not explicitly assigned to another connecting Appliance. Select this option to make this connecting Appliance the middleman for all Forescout Appliances not assigned to another connecting device.  


Note the following:  

- An error message is displayed if you try to add a device that is already used.  
- If you have apps that discover 50,000 or more endpoints, distribute the apps in such a way so that only up to two of the apps share the same focal (connecting) appliance. An alternative is to split the endpoints across multiple user accounts on multiple servers.  


Select **Next**.

### Proxy Server


Enter the Proxy Server information similar to any Forescout eyeExtend Module  

Select **Next**.  

### VMware NSX-T Options

- Enable Host Discovery: Select this option to enable the **Discovery Frequency** field.

- Discovery Frequency: Select a value for the frequency of host discovery, which is the interval between discoveries. The default is 10 minutes.

- Number of API queries per second: Select a value for the rate limiter. The default is 100 request per second. You can rate limit the requests sent to the third-party server. The rate limiter specifies the number of times a script is invoked during the specified time. It is triggered when the app starts.
