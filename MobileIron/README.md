# Use Cases  
This section describes important use cases supported by Forescout eyeExtend for MobileIron.  

## MobileIron Device Compliance Policy
Use this policy template to detect corporate hosts not enrolled with the MobileIron service, and prompt host users to enroll.  
Corporate hosts are defined as hosts that have authenticated via the HTTP Login action or have enrolled through Company Portal on their device.  
By default, users cannot browse the Internet until enrollment is complete.  
A restrictive action blocks corporate network access to users not enrolled.  
This action is disabled by default.  
    
## MDM Classification Policy (Enrollment Step-1)
Only "Mobile devices" group members should be included in the policy you are creating.

## MobileIron Device Enrollment Policy (Enrollment Step-2)
Use this policy template to detect corporate hosts not enrolled with the MobileIron service, and prompt host users to enroll.  
Corporate hosts are defined as hosts that have authenticated via the HTTP Login action or have enrolled through Company Portal on their device.  
By default, users cannot browse the Internet until enrollment is complete.  
A restrictive action blocks corporate network access to users not enrolled.  
This action is disabled by default.

  
# How It Works  
The following MobileIron components are required for this integrated solution:  
  
- **Common Platform Services (CPS) API:** The Forescout platform addresses the API exposed by the MobileIron Cor platform to retrieve endpoint information and perform actions. This supports both on-premise and connected Cloud.
  
The following Forescout platform components support the integration:  
  
- **Forescout eyeExtend for MobileIron:** This cloud-delivered module handles communication with MobileIron and provides the properties, actions, and policies described in this guide.  
- **Forescout eyeExtend Cloud:** A Forescout cloud service that handles third-party integrations including the integration with MobileIron, which provides the endpoint properties and actions described in this guide.  
- **Forescout eyeExtend Connect Plugin:** An infrastructure for integrating third-party vendors with the Forescout platform.  
- **Forescout eyeExtend MobileIron App:** The Connect App developed by Forescout to implement the integration with MobileIron.  
  
In a typical deployment, several cloud connections are defined in the Forescout platform. Connections to the cloud may be planned based on anticipated traffic or geographic location. The deployment is as follows:  
  
- A single CounterACT® device connects to each cloud access point, handling communication for a cluster of CounterACT devices. The CounterACT devices in the cluster only work with that MobileIron cloud instance.  
- For each connection, the rate limiting of messaging from the Forescout platform to the MobileIron cloud can be configured.

# Configure the Module  
After eyeExtend Connect is installed, **Connect** is displayed under **Options**.  
  
  
## Configure MobileIron App  
To configure eyeExtend for MobileIron, you import the MobileIron App and then add a system description.  
  
Initially, the App Configuration tab of the **Connect** pane is blank. The MobileIron App has not been imported yet and the system description has not been configured yet.  
  
## Import an App  
You can import the MobileIron App.  
  
To import the MobileIron App:  
  
1. In the App Configuration tab of the **Connect** pane, select **Import**.  
2. Apps that can be imported are in .zip or .eca format. They can be in any folder.  
3. Select **Import**.  
If the app is imported successfully, a message is displayed at the bottom of the **Sending** dialog box. If the app is not imported successfully, error messages are displayed in the **Sending** dialog box.  
4. Select **Close** when the import has finished. A blank **System Description** dialog box opens. See Add a System Description.  
  
- If you select **Close** before the import has finished, it will fail.  
  
## Add a System Description  
To configure the MobileIron App, you add a system description to define a connection, which includes login credentials.  
  
To add the system description:  
  
1. After the app is imported, the **System Description** dialog box opens. It is initially blank and only the **Add** and **Import** buttons are enabled.  
  
If a system description has not been configured and you select **OK** now, a warning message is displayed.  
1. Select **Add**.  
2. Enter the following information:  
  
- MobileIron Server URL: Enter the login   
- User: Enter the username for the MobileIron account.  
- Password: Enter the password for the MobileIron account.  
  
3. Select **Next**.  
 - Initially, the Assign CounterACT Devices panel has only one option, **Assign all devices by default** , and it is selected so that one device is added.  
If you want to add a second device, the Assign CounterACT Devices panel has more options.  
5. Enter the following information:  
- Connecting CounterACT Device: Select Enterprise Manager or an IP address of the connecting CounterACT device. In an environment where more than one CounterACT device is assigned to a single third-party instance, the connecting CounterACT Appliance functions as a middleman between the third-party instance and the CounterACT Appliance. The connecting CounterACT Appliance forwards all queries and requests to and from the third-party instance.  
- Assign specific devices: This CounterACT Appliance is assigned to a third-party instance, but it does not communicate with it directly. All communication between the third-party instance and its assigned CounterACT Appliance is handled by the connecting CounterACT Appliance defined for the third-party instance. All the IP addresses handled by an assigned Appliance must also be handled by the third-party instance to which the Appliance is assigned.  
  - Select **Available Devices** and then select an IP address or Appliance name from the Available Devices list.  
  - Select **Add**. The selected device will send its requests to the third-party instance through the connecting Appliance.  
- Assign all devices by default: This is the connecting Appliance to which CounterACT Appliances are assigned by default if they are not explicitly assigned to another connecting Appliance. Select this option to make this connecting Appliance the middleman for all CounterACT Appliances not assigned to another connecting device.  
  
Note the following:  
  
- An error message is displayed if you try to add a device that is already used.  
- If you have apps that discover 50,000 or more endpoints, distribute the apps in such a way so that only up to two of the apps share the same focal (connecting) appliance. An alternative is to split the endpoints across multiple user accounts on multiple servers.  
    
6. Select **Next**.  
7. Enter the following information:  
- Enable Host Discovery: Select this option to enable the **Discovery Frequency** field.  
- Discovery Frequency: Select a value for the frequency of host discovery, which is the interval between discoveries. The range is from 1 minute to 2880 minutes (48 hours). The default is 1440 minutes (24 hours).  
- MDM Query Threshold: Select a value for the rate limiter (the maximum number of API requests to the MobileIron Core Service per unit time). The range is from 1 to 1000 requests per second. The default is 10 requests per second. You can rate limit the requests sent to the third-party server. The rate limiter specifies the number of times a script is invoked during the specified time. It is triggered when the app starts.  
8. Select **Finish**. The configured system description is displayed in the **System Description** dialog box.  
  
When the system description is selected, all the buttons on the dialog box are enabled.  
  
You can create multiple system descriptions. To add another system description, select **Add** and repeat the procedure for Add a System Description.  
  
9. Select **OK** to save the system description to the CounterACT Appliance. The system description is displayed in the App Configuration tab of the **Connect** pane. There are several default columns. See Connect Pane Details.
