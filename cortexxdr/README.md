**Version v1.0.2 Cortex XDR APP**

Added Proxy server support.

**Requirements**

Added new properties and enabled Inventory on some attributes.

New properties:

 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Operating System
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint OS Version

Enabled Inventory on properties: 

 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Type
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Status
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint OS Type
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Domain
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Content Version
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Installation Package
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Active Directory
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Version
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Isolation Status
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Group Name
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Operational Status
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Operational Status Description
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Scan Status
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint Operating System
 - Cortex XDR Endpoint OS Version

**Requirements**

•	Access to Cortex XDR server

•	Forescout CounterACT 8.3, 8.2, 8.1.4

•	Forescout eyeExtend Connect 1.5 or higher

•	Ensure that NTP setting of Forescout server is Synchronized. This is important as the Advanced API Key uses Time as part of connectivity to Cortex API server.

•	See license.txt file for license information

**User Interface**

You can refer to the Forescout eyeExtend Connect Module: Connect Application Building Guide, in particular the sections on ”Define system.conf File” and “User Interface Details”.

**Cortex Console Requirements**

**Actions**

•	The Cortex Connect App allows the following actions

* Isolate endpoint – This informs the Cortex XDR server to isolate the endpoint
* Unisolate endpoint – This informs the Cortex XDR server to release the endpoint

•	Note that actions are binary and cannot be cancelled

* Apply another action to override the previous
